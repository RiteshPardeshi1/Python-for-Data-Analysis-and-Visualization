I have work with dozens of fun and real-world datasets including Amazon bestsellers, Rivian stock prices, Presidential Tweets, Bitcoin historic data, and UFO sightings datasets. Use Pandas to read and manipulate datasets  Work with DataFrames and Series objects  Organize, filter, clean, aggregate, and analyze DataFrames  Extract and manipulate date, time, and textual information from data  Master Hierarchical Indexing  Merge datasets together in Pandas  Create complex visualizations with Matplotlib  Use Seaborn to craft stunning and meaningful visualizations  Create line, bar, box, scatter, pie, violin, rug, swarm, strip, and other plots!
